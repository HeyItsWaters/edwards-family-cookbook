ingredients: 
- CHICKEN SEASONING 
- 2 tbsp kosher salt 
- 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated Orion 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dry oregano 
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
- GRILL BASTE 
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
- 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped 
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped 
- 1 tablespoon all purpose flour 
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
- 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar 
- 2 tablespoons fresh flat leaf parsley, finely chopped 
Directions: 
- Mix all seasoning ingredients together, the recipe makes more seasoning than you might need. Store in a spice bottle. 
- To make Grill Baste: 
- Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
- Add the onion and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. 
- Add the garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes. - Sprinkle in the flour, stir well, and cook without browning for 1 minute. 
- Whisk in the oil, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and sugar. 
- Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium low. 
- Add the parsley and cook, whisking often, until lightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Let cool. 
- The baste will separate. Whisk well before using. (The grill baste can be make up to 1 week ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using.) Makes about 1 1/4 cups. 
- Coat chicken in seasoning. 
- Brush the chicken well with some of the grill baste. 
- Place on the grill. 
- Cook, with the grill closed as much as possible, turning and basting well with the grill baste every 10 minutes, until an instant read thermometer, inserted in the thickest part of a breast half reads 165 degrees, about 45 minutes. 
- Transfer the to to a carving board. Let stand for 5 minutes.
