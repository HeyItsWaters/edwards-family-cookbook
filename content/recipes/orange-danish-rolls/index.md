ingredients: 
- Dough~
- 1 c + 2 TBSP of warm milk 
- 3 TBSP of oil 
- 1 egg + 2 egg whites, lightly beaten 
- 3-5 drops of Orange Extract 
- 1/2 c of Sugar 
- 4 c of Flour 
- 1 TSP of salt 
- 3 TSP of yeast 
- Filling~
- 3/4 stick of butter 
- 1 TBSP of Orange Zest 
- 1 c Sugar 
- 1 c Brown Sugar 
- 3 TBSP of Cinnamon 
- Icing~
- 2.5 c of powdered sugar 
- 3 TBSP of Heavy Cream 
- 1 TSP Orange Extract 
- 1/2 TSP Vanilla Extract 
- approximately 2 TBSP of milk 
Directions: 
- Add all ingredients for the dough into a bread machine and run on the "Dough" Cycle. Once dough is ready (apprx 1.5 hours), roll out on surface (don't add flour) until the dough is roughly 1' x 2' rectangle. 
- Preheat oven to 325 degrees 
- For the filling, melt butter and add the orange zest. Mix together, then spread on top of dough with a brush. 
- Combine sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle on top of melted butter. Make sure there is enough sugar mixture to cover the butter completely. If it is too runny at this point, all of the filling will be squished out in the next step. If needed, make more sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon mixture to add. 
- Roll up the dough. 
- Cut dough into 1.5" sections. You should have enough to make roughly 15-18 rolls. 
- Put rolls in either a non-stick pan or a light greased pan and bake for 15 minutes. Check rolls periodically to make sure they don't burn. 
- For the icing, combine powdered sugar, heavy cream, vanilla and orange extract. Whisk until it becomes a thick paste. Add in milk until desired thickness is reached (somewhere around 2-3 tbsp). Add in orange zest. 
- After rolls are cooked, let cool before icing.
